###
It is worth noting that our article is still in the review stage.
In order to protect our intellectual property, we do not provide a nanny introduction of system implementation,
only the dataset and core code of evaluation.
Of course, by reading our article, you can see how our system is implemented.

### Requirement
* Python = 3.11.xx;
* Pytorch = 2.3.1+cu121;
* You can run it in the [mynotebook](https://modelscope.cn/my/mynotebook) on modelscope for quick evaluation purposes.

### Dataset
We provide the data to make it easy for the reader to reproduce our evaluation results. 

- [aikps_123](Dataset/aikps_123.json)
- [aikps_1098](Dataset/aikps_1098.json)

### Citation
Waiting for the result of the review.
